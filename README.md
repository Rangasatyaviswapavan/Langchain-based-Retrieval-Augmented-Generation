# Langchain-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation


**Langchain-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation** is an interactive Question-Answering (Q&A) system powered by Langchain, a language processing library. It leverages retrieval-augmented generation techniques to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries.

## Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation:** Utilizes Langchain's advanced algorithms to retrieve and generate responses based on contextual understanding.
- **Streamlit Interface:** Offers an intuitive user interface powered by Streamlit, allowing users to input queries and receive responses in real-time.
- **Customizable:** Easily customizable to accommodate different datasets and adapt to specific use cases.

## Trained on Harry Potter Books Dataset âš¡ðŸ§™

This Q&A system has been trained on a dataset consisting of the Harry Potter book series to provide responses related to the magical world of Harry Potter.
